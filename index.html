      <p class="lead">Every flock begins with a pair of wings—and ours started with a spark that became a lifelong bond.
      <p>Years ago, I met a little green cheek conure at a local PetSmart who would change my life. Every time I passed by his cage, he’d rush over to the glass and press his tiny bird foot against it, as if he already knew we belonged together. For weeks, I kept coming back. And each time, he’d greet me with the same excitement—curious, energetic, and waiting.</p>

      <p>Eventually, I asked to hold him. At first, he was shy. But the moment he stepped up onto my hand, something clicked. I brought him home that day and named him Einstein—partly for his cleverness, but also because of the wild, tousled feathers on his gray little head that made him look like a feathered professor. Within days, he was talking, learning tricks, and calling out for me when I’d leave the room.</p>

      <p>But even with all that joy and connection, I could tell something was missing—he was lonely. He needed a companion, not just a caretaker.</p>

      <p>That’s when I found Sherbet. She was waiting at a Petco just outside of Oro Valley, her bright pineapple plumage glowing like a scoop of sorbet on a summer day. Playful, curious, and full of spark—she was everything Einstein needed. And when I brought her home, it was as if they’d known each other their whole lives. Within days, they were inseparable—perching together, preening each other, flying in sync like a pair of dancers who’d been practicing for years.</p>

      <p>That was nearly seven years ago, and their love has only grown stronger.</p>

      <p>Sherbet, ever the daredevil, loved hanging upside down, exploring every corner of the house, and bringing out Einstein’s playful side. Einstein, the thinker and the talker, became more expressive with Sherbet by his side—like she gave him the confidence to shine even brighter.</p>

      <p>And then… the first baby arrived.</p>

      <p>What started as a quiet friendship became a full-fledged family. Over the years, Einstein and Sherbet have raised beautiful clutches of green cheek conures, many of whom have gone on to bring love and joy into the homes of other families. Each chick is raised with care, flight, music, enrichment, and daily affection—just like their parents.</p>

      <p>At JP’s Feathered Friends, we don’t just raise birds. We nurture love stories, foster lifelong bonds, and help new families take flight.</p>

      <p>Whether you’re just discovering the magic of conures or ready to find a feathered companion of your own, we’re so glad you’re here. Let our story inspire yours.</p>
